# 🧠 BrainLeash Breaker – The Neuroscience PSYOP Defense Game

They hijack your amygdala → cortisol flood → compliance.  
We hijack it back → neuroplasticity → mass resistance.

## How to Play (15 seconds)
1. Spot the tactic  
2. Trace the red pathway on the brain diagram  
3. Deploy counter → green pathway lights up  
4. Post with overlay → +NHP score  
5. Tag 3 brains → replicate

🎮 How to Play (15-Second Loop – TikTok/Reels Ready)
1.  Spot the Tactic Live: Notice the flip (quiet → chaos, rep bomb, etc.) in your day.
2.  Trace the Pathway: Screenshot/use the Brain Diagram. Follow RED arrow (hijack: Sensory → Thalamus → Amygdala → HPA Axis → Cortisol Flood → Effector Damage). ￼ ￼
3.  Deploy Counter: Execute green path action → Engage Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) for top-down inhibition. ￼
4.  Post Proof: Overlay text/brain arrow on your clip → “+[NHP] #BrainLeashBreaker [Tactic] Total: XXX” → Tag 3 players.
5.  Bonus x2: Stitch/duet another → “Chain Confirmed: Mirror Neurons Activated.”
